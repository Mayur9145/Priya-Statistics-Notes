# Probability Concepts

## 1. Probability
**Probability** is a measure of the likelihood that an event will occur, expressed as a number between 0 and 1. A probability of 0 means the event cannot occur, while a probability of 1 means it is certain to occur. It is calculated as:

\[
P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}
\]

### Example:
If a coin is tossed, the probability of getting heads (event A) is:

\[
P(A) = \frac{1}{2}
\]

## 2. Event
An **event** is any specific outcome or a set of outcomes of a random experiment. Events can be:
- **Simple Event**: An event with a single outcome.
- **Compound Event**: An event with two or more outcomes.

### Example:
When rolling a die:
- A simple event could be rolling a "3".
- A compound event could be rolling an even number, which includes {2, 4, 6}.

## 3. Sample Space
The **sample space (S)** is the set of all possible outcomes of an experiment.

### Example:
For rolling a die, the sample space is:

\[
S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}
\]

## 4. Experiment
An **experiment** is a procedure that produces outcomes, which can be observed and recorded. The outcomes are not predictable with certainty.

### Example:
- Tossing a coin is an experiment, as it can result in heads or tails.
- Rolling a die is another experiment, as it can result in any number from 1 to 6.

## 5. Types of Events

### (a) **Independent Events**
Two events are **independent** if the occurrence of one does not affect the occurrence of the other.

#### Example:
Tossing a coin and rolling a die are independent events because the result of the coin toss does not affect the die roll.

### (b) **Dependent Events**
Two events are **dependent** if the occurrence of one affects the occurrence of the other.

#### Example:
Drawing two cards from a deck without replacement is a dependent event because the first draw affects the probability of the second draw.

### (c) **Mutually Exclusive Events**
Events are **mutually exclusive** if they cannot happen at the same time.

#### Example:
When rolling a die, getting a "2" and getting a "5" are mutually exclusive, as both cannot happen simultaneously.

### (d) **Complementary Events**
Two events are **complementary** if one event occurs if and only if the other does not occur.

#### Example:
If A is the event of rolling a 6 on a die, the complement of A is the event of **not** rolling a 6.

\[
P(A^c) = 1 - P(A)
\]

## 6. Conditional Probability
**Conditional probability** is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. It is denoted as:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
\]

Where:
- \(P(A|B)\) is the probability of event A given event B has occurred.
- \(P(A \cap B)\) is the probability of both A and B occurring.
- \(P(B)\) is the probability of event B.

### Example:
If we know that a card drawn from a deck is a spade (event B), the probability that it is also an ace (event A) is:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(\text{Ace and Spade})}{P(\text{Spade})} = \frac{\frac{1}{52}}{\frac{13}{52}} = \frac{1}{13}
\]



# Bayes' Theorem in Probability

Bayes' Theorem describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event. The exact definition of Bayes' Theorem is:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(A|B) \) is the posterior probability: the probability of event \( A \) occurring given that \( B \) is true.
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood: the probability of event \( B \) occurring given that \( A \) is true.
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability: the initial probability of event \( A \) before seeing evidence.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal likelihood: the probability of event \( B \) occurring.

# Applying Bayes' Theorem in a Large Example: Combining Deep Learning, Machine Learning, NLP, and LLMs

Let's consider a real-world problem: **Identifying relevant customer reviews** about a product using a large language model (LLM) and applying Bayes' Theorem.

## Problem:
You have a dataset of customer reviews, and you want to classify whether a review is positive or negative using an LLM, combined with traditional machine learning and NLP methods. We’ll use Bayes’ Theorem to estimate the probability that a review is positive (event \( A \)) given certain keywords or features extracted from the review (event \( B \)).

### Steps:

### Step 1: Preprocessing with NLP
- **Tokenization:** Break each review into words (tokens).
- **Stop-word Removal:** Remove irrelevant words like "the," "is," etc.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extract meaningful features such as important keywords, sentiment, and term frequency (TF-IDF).

### Step 2: Train a Machine Learning Model
- **Training:** Train a sentiment classifier (e.g., Naive Bayes or SVM) on labeled review data. For each word (or feature) \( B \), we calculate:
  - \( P(B|A) \): The probability of the word appearing in a positive review.
  - \( P(B|\neg A) \): The probability of the word appearing in a negative review.

### Step 3: Apply Deep Learning (LLM)
- **Fine-Tune an LLM:** Fine-tune a pre-trained LLM (e.g., GPT-3) on customer review data. The model learns contextual representations of reviews.
  - For a given review \( B \), the LLM can predict probabilities \( P(B|A) \) for different sentiments using its deep understanding of language.

### Step 4: Use Bayes' Theorem for Classification
Given a new review \( B \), we use Bayes' Theorem to compute the probability that the review is positive:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) \cdot P(A)}{P(B)}
\]

Where:
- \( P(A) \) is the prior probability of a positive review, which can be estimated from the overall dataset (e.g., if 60% of reviews are positive, \( P(A) = 0.6 \)).
- \( P(B|A) \) is the likelihood of observing the specific words (or features) from the review if it is positive. This comes from the machine learning model and LLM.
- \( P(B) \) is the marginal probability of the review's features, which can be calculated as:
  
  \[
  P(B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A) + P(B|\neg A) \cdot P(\neg A)
  \]

### Step 5: Combine Results from ML and LLM
- **Weighted Averaging:** Combine predictions from both the traditional ML model and the LLM, weighting each model's prediction based on their confidence or accuracy.
  
### Step 6: Decision Threshold
- Finally, if \( P(A|B) > 0.5 \), classify the review as positive; otherwise, classify it as negative.

### Example:
Assume the following simplified values:
- \( P(A) = 0.6 \) (60% of reviews are positive).
- The word "excellent" appears in the review \( B \).
- \( P(B|A) = 0.8 \) (80% of positive reviews contain "excellent").
- \( P(B|\neg A) = 0.3 \) (30% of negative reviews contain "excellent").

Now, applying Bayes' Theorem:

\[
P(A|B) = \frac{0.8 \times 0.6}{(0.8 \times 0.6) + (0.3 \times 0.4)} = \frac{0.48}{0.48 + 0.12} = \frac{0.48}{0.6} = 0.8
\]

Thus, there's an 80% chance that the review is positive given the presence of the word "excellent."

### Step 7: Post-processing and Validation
- Evaluate the model on a validation set to tune hyperparameters and improve performance.
- Consider techniques like ensembling to further improve results.

# Conclusion:
By combining traditional machine learning, deep learning, and LLMs, we can effectively use Bayes' Theorem to classify reviews and solve complex NLP problems. This approach leverages both statistical methods and advanced neural networks to handle large-scale, real-world datasets.
