# Pearson Coefficient for Skewness in Statistics

The Pearson coefficient for skewness is a measure of the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable. There are two forms:

1. **Pearson's First Coefficient of Skewness (Mode Skewness)**:
   \[
   Sk_1 = \frac{\bar{X} - \text{Mode}}{\sigma}
   \]
   Where:
   - \(\bar{X}\) = Mean of the data
   - Mode = Mode of the data
   - \(\sigma\) = Standard deviation of the data

2. **Pearson's Second Coefficient of Skewness (Median Skewness)**:
   \[
   Sk_2 = 3 \times \frac{\bar{X} - \text{Median}}{\sigma}
   \]
   Where:
   - \(\bar{X}\) = Mean of the data
   - Median = Median of the data
   - \(\sigma\) = Standard deviation of the data

## Example 1: Pearson's First Coefficient of Skewness
Consider a dataset where the mean is 50, the mode is 45, and the standard deviation is 10.

\[
Sk_1 = \frac{50 - 45}{10} = \frac{5}{10} = 0.5
\]
The data is positively skewed.

## Example 2: Pearson's Second Coefficient of Skewness
Consider a dataset where the mean is 50, the median is 48, and the standard deviation is 12.

\[
Sk_2 = 3 \times \frac{50 - 48}{12} = 3 \times \frac{2}{12} = 0.5
\]
The data is again positively skewed.
