## Kurtosis in Statistics

**Definition:**

Kurtosis is a statistical measure used to describe the distribution of data points in a dataset. It specifically measures the "tailedness" of the distribution. There are three main types of kurtosis:

1. **Leptokurtic**: Distribution with heavier tails and a sharper peak compared to a normal distribution (kurtosis > 3).
2. **Platykurtic**: Distribution with lighter tails and a flatter peak compared to a normal distribution (kurtosis < 3).
3. **Mesokurtic**: Distribution similar to a normal distribution (kurtosis = 3).

**Example:**

Consider the following dataset:

##   Data: [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]




Calculate the kurtosis using a statistical software or formula to determine whether this dataset is leptokurtic, platykurtic, or mesokurtic. 

For a normal distribution, the kurtosis value is 3. If the dataset's kurtosis is greater than 3, it's leptokurtic; if less than 3, it's platykurtic.
