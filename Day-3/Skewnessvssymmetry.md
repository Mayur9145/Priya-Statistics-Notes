## Skewness vs Symmetry in Statistics

### Skewness
- **Definition**: Skewness measures the asymmetry of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable about its mean.
- **Types**:
  - **Positive Skewness**: Distribution tail is on the right side. Example: Income distribution in a country.
  - **Negative Skewness**: Distribution tail is on the left side. Example: Age at retirement.
- **Example**:
  - For a dataset of income where most people earn below average and a few earn extremely high, the distribution is positively skewed.

### Symmetry
- **Definition**: Symmetry refers to the property of a distribution where the left side is a mirror image of the right side. A perfectly symmetric distribution has no skewness.
- **Types**:
  - **Perfect Symmetry**: The mean, median, and mode are equal. Example: Normal distribution.
  - **No Symmetry**: The distribution is skewed. Example: The distribution of the number of goals scored in a football match.
- **Example**:
  - A dataset where the scores of students in an exam are distributed evenly around the mean with no extreme values skewing the distribution would be considered symmetric.
